=== Creating merge requests (the cool way)

The following script will extract the jira story out of the branch name and create a merge request with a title and description. The target branch is selected via `fzf` by listing all origin branches. After creating the merge request it will be opened in the browser for convenience.

NOTE: You need to have `glab` and `fzf` installed.

.Create merge request
[source,console]
====
include::bin/glmr[]
====

Save this script in a bin folder and make it executable or integrate it as a function in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`. In my case I have a `~/bin` folder in my path and stored the script in `glmr`:
