=== Enabling autocompletion for AWS CLI

As I am often using autocompletion, here is how to enable it for the AWS CLI:

[source,sh]
----
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
autoload bashcompinit && bashcompinit
complete -C aws_completer aws
----

=== Switching between AWS profiles

If you are using multiple AWS profiles for different AWS accounts, you can switch between them by setting the `AWS_PROFILE` and temporary credentials environment variable.
Therefor, you can use the following script:

.awsp script
[source,shell]
----
include::bin/awsp[]
----

NOTE: 1password is used to retrieve the MFA token via the `op` command, so you have to replace the `<AWS User Item>` with the name of your AWS user item in 1password. If you don't have `op` installed, a prompt will ask you for the MFA token.
